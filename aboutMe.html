    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>I am Charell Peterkin, I am single mom of two beautiful daughters age 11 and 9. I am a smart, kind, charming, and ambitious person. I decided to change careers because I want to be on the right side of future inventors and creators. I wanted a career that would fill my passion and also grow with the times. I am interested in backend development. I love to be behind the scenes of a great idea, and be the person that brings the idea to fruition.</p>
